### Step 2: Access DNS Management

2. Find your domain in the list and click "DNS" or "Manage DNS" next to it.

### Step 3: Add a CNAME Record
1. In the DNS Management page, scroll down to the "Records" section.
2. Click "Add" to create a new record.
3. Select "CNAME" from the Type dropdown menu.
4. In the "Host" field, enter the subdomain you want to use (e.g., `www`).
5. In the "Points to" field, enter the URL provided by ngrok (e.g., `your-subdomain.ngrok.io`).
6. Set the TTL to your desired value (default is fine).
7. Click "Save" to add the record.

    ```
3. Note the forwarding URL provided by ngrok (e.g., `your-subdomain.ngrok.io`).

### Step 5: Verify Your Domain
1. Open a browser and go to your custom domain (e.g., `www.yourdomain.com`).
2. It should now forward to your local server via ngrok.
